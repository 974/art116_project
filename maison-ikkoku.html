  <h1>Maison Ikkoku</h1>
  <h3>A normal anime for normal people</h3>
</div>

	<p>Have you ever wanted a nice normal anime that won't have your friends roll their eyes at you if you suggest watching it? If your answer is yes we definitely have a show for you.</p>

	<p>Maison Ikkoku is yet another romantic comedy anime, based on a comic by famed Manga creator Rumiko Takahashi. Unlike her other works there are no aliens, martial arts, ghosts, magic or anything else. Just normal people living normal lives. Her trademark humor is mostly still intact however, the slapstick may be lighter, and the character a little less buffoon like, but I doesn't feel to different from Urusei Yatsura or Ranma ½.</p>

	<p>The story is about a down on his luck student named Godai. Poor Godai has failed his college entrance exams, lives in a run down old tenement building and it constantly tormented by his wild hard partying neighbors. Just as he is about to leave the building after being fed up with the conditions however, Godai a new manager, Kyoko , arrives to take care of the building. Godai is instantly smitten and decides to stay. The rest of the show involves the steps and missteps of Godai trying to build a relationship with Kyoko</p>

    </div>

	<p>Another title I was debating on for this review was Alcohol: the anime. Because there is a lot of alcohol consumption in this anime. Godai's tenant mates seem to want to party and drink excessively every night and ty the best to rope everyone else around them into it as well, especially Goadai and the Apartment manager Kyoko.</p>

	<p>All the drunkeness in this show inspired me to think up The Maison Ikkoku Drinking Game. Whenever a character in the shows takes a drink you take a drink. A little way to get you immersed in the show.</p>

	<p>Disclaimer: We Review Anime does not endorse excessive alcohol consumption. We have not tested this game and suggest if you do want to try, know when to stop.</p>

    </div>

	<p>The show is fairly long by modern anime standards clocking in at 96 episodes. It also suffers from some mild pacing issues. The first season is pretty exciting but by the second season things start to get stagnant. The third season manages to inject some more excitement back into the show with more characters but then the final season takes forever to wrap up the whole story. So the pacing is a bit messy, but fortunately nothing is so dull as to make you want to stop watching.</p>

	<p>Overall the show is a pretty good pick if yo want something a little less out there to watch. It's kind of long and has minor pacing issues, but overall it's a fun ride provided you don't try and watch to much too fat. I give it 4 Glasses of Plum Wine out of 5.</p>
