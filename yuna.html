  <h1>Galaxy Fraulein Yuna</h1>
  <h3>Rots your brain and your Teeth</h3>
</div>

<p>The 1990s was a weird time for magical girl anime. The genre was moving away from the girl solves problems with magic style of past decades. But it had not yets settled into endless copies of Sailor Moon yet either. So we instead got a lot of reallly creative shows playing with idea of Sailor Moon but taking them in all sorts of unusual directions.</p>

<p>And on of these shows was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna a series of two OVA's based off of a video game series based off of the idea of combining magical girls and giant robots. If you think that's a little strange than you probably aren't ready to read me recap of the show.</p>

<p>The first OVA, Galaxy Fraulein Yuna sends us straight into the world of superhero, celebrity and student Yuna and her absurdly gluttonous robot friend Yuri. And by gluttonous we mean eats everything, including bumps on Yuna's head. Why does a robot need to eat so much anyway?</p>

<p>So the story starts with a giant robot cooking contest between Yuna and Polylina her superhero/celebrity crush. This has no other real bearing on the story other than to establish how silly this show is going to get The actual story starts with new girl in school who seems to be looking at Yuna with suspicion. Yuna being the happy go lucky full on friendship kind of girl she just thinks she is being hit on and spends all of her classtime daydreaming about it. But in reality the new girl is an undercover space police agent, who is investigating Yuna for being a threat to the Galaxy.</p>

<p>But wait why would she think Yuna is a threat? Because villainous Fraulein D is trying to frame her and has sent out her two goofy henchwomen to carry out her fiendish plan. We then follow Yuna and Yuri outside of school where we find a crying little girl who lost her puppy. Yuna promises to get it back and runs off to the rescue. But Fraulein D's henchmen are behind making sue this task keeps Yuna distracted, while a copy of Yuna's giant robot destroys the city for the space police lady to see.</p>

<p>But the question I know you're really dying to know is, does Yuna save that puppy? But of course she does and a huge crowd a of people cheer even the wacky henchmen. Good thing thing it looks like the whole town was too busy watching Yuna save a puppy to be there for the destruction of their city. The first episode ends with Yuna being arrested and Polylina trying to save her.</p>

<p>Episode 2 starts of with Yuna in chains and a cell. And the first thing that comes to Yuna's mind? Something dirty. And at this point any thought that this show is for kids melts away. Though I guess it's subtle enough whee it would go over their heads. But yeah, Yuna doesn't seem to be very smart. We find out Yuna has been declared a threat to the galaxy and will be executed by being fired into a black hole.</p>

<p>But fortunately Polylina convinces the police lady of Yuna's innocence and they go in to rescue her and Fraulien D's evil plot is revealed. The the butt kicking commences with Yuna defeating Fraulein D but not before a stereotypical “curse you” villain speech. We then cut to the hospital with all of Yuna's friend where the space police woman apologizes for the mistake of almost getting Yuna executed. Yuna says she will only if she will be her friend. Police woman accepts and the show ends on a note of a cliched kid's show friendship moral.</p>

<p>I bet you think I am making all this up to be funny. I am actually being completely serious go watch it for yourself.</p>

<p>So my final evaluation: This show is really really dumb. It will kill your brain cells. But the combination of stupid and saccharine cliched kid's show themes give it a certain charm. It's the entertaining kind of dumb, the kind you'll be glad you experienced. Thus I give Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 4 out of 5 puppies.</p>
