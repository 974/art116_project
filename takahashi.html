  <h1>Rumiko Takahashi Comedies</h1>
  <h3>A guide to what's what</h3>
</div>

	<p>Rumiko Takahashi is a very popular and prolific manga creator, and has made a lot s of great stuff. We decided to make a guide for our readers to better distinguish the differences between her 3 major comedy series to help provide a nice overview, and help you select a starting point for what to watch first.</p>	

	<p>Takahashi's first successful series was Urusei Yatsura. Originally published in 1978 it got and a a TV show two years later which ran for 197 episodes, plus 11 or so direct to video releases and 6 movies the last of which was released in 1993. Which makes it her longest work as well.</p>
	
	<p>The story is about about the worlds most lecherous and obnoxious Teenage boy, Atau, and the teenage alien princess Lum who for some reason loves and chases after him. Wacky hijinks ensue.</p>

	<p>Compared to later series this show is weird and very slapstick.  Ataru has a knack for always getting into trouble and causing weird things to happen from demons, fairies, dinosaurs and flying ice cream cones. Lum's persistence usually just makes things worse, especially when she starts to use her alien technology to solve problems. And the two of them seem to be a magnet for weirdness. The side characters are also on the wacky end, with Ataru's classmates and Lum's alien friends getting in on the crazy hijinks as well. Very frequently episodes tend to end in total chaos.</p>

	<p>The most notable thing about this series however is that it is simultaneously deals a lot with Japanese culture and is a lot closer to the standards of American cartoons than a lot of other anime. There are tons of references to Japanese culture and mythology, Lum is even based of the the Oni, a mythical Japanese Ogre. But the structure and tone of the show is very cartoony, the most similar show I could compare it to is Dexter's Lab rather than even Takahashi's other works.</p>

	<p>Her second major manga, Maison Ikkoku, came out in 1980 and was published at the concurrently with Urusei Yatsura until they both ended in 1986. The anime however, came out after the manga had ended and ran 96 episodes from 1987-1988, making it considerably shorter than Urusei Yatsura. There was a movie and one or two straight to video releases, but they are mostly just fluff material.</p>

      <h5>Aliens? What are you talking about?</h5>
    </div>
    
	<p>The main reason for this is because Maison Ikkoku is a lot more focused on telling a story. The show is about a loser student named Godai and his quest to win the affections of his landlady, Kyoko. It has a much stronger romance element than Urusei Yatsura and is definitely a lot more down to earth, with no weird out of the ordinary stuff at all.</p> 

	<p>This isn't to say it's dull however, there is still plenty of crazy comedy involved mostly from all the terrible things that befall upon Godai and the crazy drunken antics of his fellow tenents. If Urusei Yatsura is a lot like a cartoon however, Maison Ikkoku is much more like a sitcom.</p>

	<p>Takashi's third long running comedy and the last one to get animated, Ranma ½ was published in 1987 and received an animated adaptation two yeas later after Maison Ikkoku's TV series had ended. It ran for 161 episodes before ending in 1992, 4 years before the manga was done, so not everything had the chance to be animated. There where also two movies and some home video leases that came out after the show had ended.</p>

	<p>Ranma ½ is about a teenage martial artist named Ranma Saotome who is cursed. Whenever he is splashed with cold water he becomes a woman and must be doused in hot water to turn back. He also has the misfortune of being engaged to too many different women. Thus comedy ensues.</p>

    </div>

	<p>Ranma ½ sort of meets the middle ground between Maison Ikkoku and Urusei Yatsura. It takes more of it's humor style from the former, but it episodic like the latter. It also throws in lots of martial action into the mix. Episodes typically evolve around Ranma getting into fights, having issues with his fiancés or having to deal with strange items and magic that tends to pass through town.</p>

	<p>So now you know the differences between these three shows. We hope this has helped you better understand the differences between these shows and hope it has helped you decide which ones are fo you and which ones you should try first.
