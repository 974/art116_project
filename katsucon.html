  <h4>Convention Report</h4>
  <h1>Katsucon 2014</h1>
  <h3>Lineapalooza</h3>
</div>

<p>Katsucon has been growing rapidly in these past few years, ever since it moved to the Gaylord Hotel. This year we decided to do a full report on the convention to fill in everyone who missed it or is sitting on the fence as to whether or not they want to go next year. This is the start of a breand new category of articles on our site called convention reports, where we fill you in on all sots of Anime related events across the country.</p>

	<p>The first thing I noticed when arriving to the convention was how crowded it was. Actually scratch that, the first thing I really noticed was a guy in a Bob Ross costume, which was the best one of the entire convention. But anyway, things were very crowded. Especially the line for preregistration. I was waiting for at least an hour and a half, and from what I could gather talking to other guests, I was lucky it was that short. I nearly passed out waiting in line and I am not quite sure of the group next to us acting out entire episodes of Spongebob was a blessing or a curse.</p>

      <h5>We never knew Bob Ross was such a big anime fan</h5>

	<p>After that long line wait  in line it was clear that I had to get food immediately, so I had to miss out on some interesting events to make sure everything was in working order. This would be a good time to talk about the dining options around the convention. It's a pretty high cost area so there isn't much in the way of cheap food othe than Subway. I ended up eating at the Burrito place everyday, which wasn't too terribly expensive, and was filling. Food was a slight pain to get, but nothing too major.</p>

      <h5>Even cyborgs need to eat</h5>
    </div>
    
	<p>Now to move onto the actual fun parts of the convention. Artists Alley was pretty much what you expect, a bunch of people selling fanarts, crafts and comics they made. Dealers room was the same, overpriced video games, a bunch of stuff you could get anywhee. Sadly the Japanese language manga that was previously available there wasn't there this year. The game room was gratly improved in selection, lots of games that are hard to find and some nice arcade machines to play on. Unfortunately the game room policies whee rather Draconian this year, no bags or jackets of any sort where involved, which being at convention in winter, meant that you had to make special trips to rid yourself of offending items just to go in and play a few games, which was really inconvenient.</p>

	<p>The best part of the convention however where the panels. Like it they have been for the last few years, they have been kind of isolated from the rest of the convention, but it's good to have a breather while waiting for events. Most of the panels where of very high quality this year, with a lot of intelligent topics to discuss. There was a lot of time spent also trying to figure out on how to deal with some of the issues plaguing the convention, some of it led by the staff, so hopefully things will be better next year.</p>

	<p>The convention overall was okay, but it seems to be a bit of a victim of it's own success. They don't seem to be able handle the ever increasing numbers of attendees and the convention feels a little fractured, with it sometimes feeling like two separate events, a massive costume party and market place on one end and a separate event dedicated to viewing and discussion on the other. Which may not be an entirely positive thing for people who are interested in both aspects. Overall while the convention was fun I would recommend anyone going next year to plan ahead to avoid some of the issues of this year and to keep aware that it may take a little digging to find all the convention has to offer.</p>
